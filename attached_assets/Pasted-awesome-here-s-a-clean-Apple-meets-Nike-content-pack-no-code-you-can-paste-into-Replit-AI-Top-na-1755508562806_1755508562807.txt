Selection for Starters

Skill level, attendance, coach’s tactical needs considered.

Unless there’s clear positional/skill advantage, regular members have priority.

Participation Benefits

More attendance → better tactical roles, stronger team chemistry.

Tournament Policy

NSF entry under official business-trip status; typical flow: Day 1 Qualifiers → Day 2 Main Round (win to extend to Day 3). Travel per guidelines: meal, per-diem, lodging.

Operations

Venue fee ≈ ₩100,000 per week; beverage ≈ ₩10,000; guest revenue typically ≈ ₩50,000. We must collect ≥ ₩50,000 in dues monthly to operate.

If total monthly dues ≥ ₩50,000 and guest fees together cover venue costs, the game organizer may receive a one-month dues waiver (₩19,000) for that session.
