Add an admin “Edit Post” flow and show the post date on the Board.

Requirements

1) Edit page
- Route: /admin/edit/:id
- Create a page similar to AdminNewPostPage with fields:
  - Title (required)
  - YouTube URL (required)
  - Description (optional, ~200 chars with live counter)
- Pre-fill values by fetching the row from table "youtube posts" by id.
- Reuse normalizeYouTubeUrl() and youtubeId parsing.
- Duplicate check: before saving, verify that no other row (id != current id) has the same youtube_id.
  - If duplicate, show: “This video is already posted.”
- Validation: trim inputs; require valid video id; block when description > 200; disable Save while checking/saving.
- Buttons: “Save Changes” (updates the row) and “Cancel” (navigates back to /board).
- After successful save, show a success toast and navigate to /board (or stay and show “Saved”).

2) Link to Edit
- On the Board cards, if the user is admin, show a small “Edit” control (button or icon) that links to /admin/edit/{id}.
- Keep the current card layout; do not affect non-admin users.

3) Show posted date on Board
- On each Board card, display the post date from created_at in a small, muted text line (e.g., “Posted on 2025-08-25” or locale format).
- If created_at is missing, skip the date line.
- Maintain CLS stability; do not change card image aspect ratio.

4) Keep existing design
- Don’t change global styling; match the look & feel of the New Post form.
- Keep loading/empty/error states intact.
- Use the shared Supabase client from src/lib/supabaseClient.ts.
- Do not use service keys.

5) RLS note
- This project already has UPDATE policy for admins; use it.
- If UPDATE fails due to policy, confirm the policy checks profiles.role='admin' using auth.uid().

Acceptance
- Admins can click “Edit” on a card, land on /admin/edit/:id, update fields, and save successfully.
- Duplicate videos are blocked with a friendly message.
- The Board shows a posted date line under each card’s content.
- Non-admins never see Edit controls.
- No layout shifts, and thumbnails keep 16:9 with lazy loading.
